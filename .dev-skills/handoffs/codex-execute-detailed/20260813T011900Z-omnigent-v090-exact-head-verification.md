# Omnigent v0.9 exact-head verification

Summary: PRE-PUBLICATION PASS. This receipt supersedes the original execution
receipt for merge consideration and applies to the exact PR commit containing
this file. The final implementation parent is `d5b3d7c`, and no source or evidence
files may change after this receipt is committed without another full run.

## Scope

- PR: `Consiliency/omniagent-plus#14`
- Branch: `codex/implement-omnigent-v0-9`
- Plan: `plans/detailed-omnigent-v0-9-accommodations-20260812-180838.md`
- Stable authority: Omnigent `v0.9.0` at
  `cc4720a79fbdf9ccee56724bf571e7d48e1d9ac2`
- Release candidate: `@consiliency/omnigent-transport@0.5.0`
- Sibling public package versions: `0.2.0`, unchanged

## Exact-Head Gates

- Focused transport suite: PASS, including malformed acknowledgement rejection,
  cross-stream terminal-candidate retirement, late persisted-history
  reconciliation, stable-message reconnect continuation, and legacy CLI root
  session creation isolation.
- `pnpm build`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 100 files and 250 tests passed; one credentialed live smoke
  skipped by default.
- `pnpm --filter @consiliency/omnigent-transport test:pack`: PASS
- Omnigent fixture JSON validation: PASS
- `git diff --check`: PASS
- `phase-loop validate-roadmap specs/phase-plans-v1.md`: PASS, 13 phases
- GitHub commit status `exact-head-verification`: posted as success only after
  every command above completed on the receipt-containing commit.

## Review Reconciliation

- Status-only terminalized provisional IDs leave the reconnect FIFO but retain
  exact-history reconciliation keys. The provider integration test closes the
  first stream, binds turn three on a new stream, then supplies persisted rows
  for turns one and two and proves both old handles reconcile exactly.
- Tagged HTTP child `session.created` remains metadata-only. Legacy CLI resume
  history and attach streams use a dedicated legacy mapper and retain root
  `runtime.session.created` behavior.
- Event acknowledgements are runtime-normalized. Accepted input requires literal
  `queued: true` with optional non-empty `item_id` or `pending_id`; synchronous
  denial requires `denied: true`, `queued: false`, and a non-empty reason. Empty,
  false-queued send-turn, or mistyped shapes fail as non-retryable
  `malformed_response` and cannot create an active handle. Control events retain
  the official successful `{queued:false}` response.
- Official v0.9 `ConversationItem.to_api_dict()` rows are flat: type-specific
  fields are spread beside `id`, `response_id`, `type`, `status`, and
  `created_at`. The authority fixture, fake server, client boundary, snapshot and
  paginated-history tests, and history mapper all use that frozen shape; nested
  synthetic `data` rows are no longer accepted as conformance evidence.

## Boundaries

This remains transport-only and additive. It does not broaden child-session,
harness, routing, approval, XG-1, lease, or lock authority. The existing trusted
publish workflow is unchanged and was not dispatched before merge because its
manual path also publishes. The primary checkout's unrelated `mcp_server.log`
was not modified, staged, or included.
